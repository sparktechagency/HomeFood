          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          account credentials.

          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate

          Delivery charges, minimum order requirements, and pickup timings must
          be transparently communicated via the seller dashboard.
          <br />
          Sellers may not use misleading images or information to promote their

          Sellers are expected to confirm the order within a reasonable time or
          communicate if unavailable.
