          [Your Website Name] connects home chefs (sellers) with customers
          (buyers) who are interested in ordering freshly prepared homemade
          meals. We facilitate the order process, payment handling, and

          food.
        </p>

          <strong>3. User Accounts</strong>
          <br />
          Users must register with accurate and up-to-date information.
          <br />
          You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
          account credentials.
          <br />
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>4. Home Chefs (Sellers)</strong>

          meals, ingredients, allergens, and availability.

          compliance with local food laws or permits.

          Delivery charges, minimum order requirements, and pickup timings must
          be transparently communicated via the seller dashboard.
          <br />
          Sellers may not use misleading images or information to promote their
          dishes.

          Once an order is placed, sellers receive a notification and begin
          preparing the food.

          Sellers are expected to confirm the order within a reasonable time or
          communicate if unavailable.
